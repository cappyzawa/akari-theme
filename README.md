# akari-theme

A terminal color palette inspired by Japanese alleys lit by round lanterns.

Akari (灯) means *light* in Japanese.
This theme is not about darkness, rain, or neon —
it is about warm light, quiet streets, and the presence of life at night.

## Concept

Akari is inspired by a familiar Japanese scene:

- Narrow residential alleys
- Soft, **round lanterns** glowing above
- Wood, stone, plants, and warm shadows
- A night that feels alive, not silent

The goal is to translate this atmosphere into a terminal experience that feels calm,
warm, and readable for long sessions.

## Color Philosophy

- **Light is singular** — Only one warm color (lantern orange) serves as the primary accent
- **Blue is air, not light** — Blue represents the night sky, not a light source
- **Purple stays quiet** — Muted purple for distance, never neon
- **Green is life** — Represents plants and human presence
- **Black is gray** — True black doesn't exist in a lit alley; use warm grays instead
