## Dawn Theme

The same alley at dawn — lanterns still lit, but yielding to daylight.

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right

## Notes

- Both themes feature the signature lantern color for active tab highlighting
- Due to Chrome manifest v3 limitations, customizable elements are limited
- For more detailed color control, consider using CSS extension tools like Stylus
- Only one theme can be active at a time
