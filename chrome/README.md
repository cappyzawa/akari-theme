## Notes

- Both themes use lantern colors as text accents on active tabs
- Toolbar has subtle contrast with frame for visual hierarchy
- Due to Chrome manifest v3 limitations, customizable elements are limited
- For more detailed color control, consider using CSS extension tools like Stylus
- You can only have one theme active at a time
