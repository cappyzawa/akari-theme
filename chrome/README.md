Chrome browser themes inspired by Japanese alleys lit by round lanterns.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cappyzawa/akari-chrome.git
```

### Night Theme

Night alley with warm shadows and lantern light.

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `akari-chrome/night/` directory

**Key colors:** Dark backgrounds (#171B22) with lantern orange active tabs (#E26A3B)

### Dawn Theme

The same alley at dawn — lanterns still lit, but yielding to daylight.

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `akari-chrome/dawn/` directory

**Key colors:** Light backgrounds (#E4DED6) with fading lantern active tabs (#8A4530)

## Notes

- Both themes feature the signature lantern color for active tab highlighting
- Due to Chrome manifest v3 limitations, customizable elements are limited
- For more detailed color control, consider using CSS extension tools like Stylus
- Only one theme can be active at a time
