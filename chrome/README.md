## Notes

- Night theme uses the bright lantern (`#E26A3B`) as the primary accent
- Dawn theme uses warm amber (`#B07840`) for a softer morning feel
- Due to Chrome manifest v3 limitations, customizable elements are limited
- For more detailed color control, consider using CSS extension tools like Stylus
- You can only have one theme active at a time
