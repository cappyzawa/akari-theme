## ☀️ Dawn Theme

The same alley at dawn — lanterns still lit, but yielding to daylight.

**Installation:**

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked"

## Notes

- Night theme uses the bright lantern (`#E26A3B`) as the primary accent
- Dawn theme uses the fading lantern (`#8A4530`) to reflect morning light
- Due to Chrome manifest v3 limitations, customizable elements are limited
- For more detailed color control, consider using CSS extension tools like Stylus
- You can only have one theme active at a time
